# RICorDE

RICorDE produces gridded water depth estimates from flood inundation data by incorporating a HAND sub-model and cost distancing algorithms to extrapolate edge values into the inundated region. 

RICorDE has moved and now lives on [NRCan's GitHub ](https://github.com/NRCan/RICorDE/tree/main)
